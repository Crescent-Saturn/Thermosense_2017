\begin{abstract}
Pulsed Thermography (PT) is one of the most common methods in Active Thermography procedures of the Thermography for NDT \& E (Nondestructive Testing \& Evaluation), due to the rapidity and convenience of this inspection technique. Flashes or lamps are often used to heat the samples in the traditional PT. This paper mainly explores exactly the opposite external stimulation in IR Thermography: cooling instead of heating. A steel sample with flat-bottom holes of different depths and sizes has been tested. Liquid nitrogen (LN$_2$) is sprinkled on the surface of the specimen and the whole process is captured by a thermal camera. To obtain a good comparison, two other classic NDT techniques, Pulsed Thermography and Lock-In Thermography, are also employed. In particular, the  Lock-in  method  is  implemented  with  three  different  frequencies.  In  the  image  processing  procedure,  the Principal Component Thermography (PCT) method has been performed on all thermal images. For Lock-In results, both Phase and Amplitude images are generated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Results show that all techniques presented part of the defects while the LN$_2$ technique displays the flaws only at the beginning of the test. Moreover, a binary threshold post-processing is applied to the thermal images, and by comparing these images to a binary map of the location of the defects, the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are established and discussed. A comparison of the results indicates that the better ROC curve is obtained using the Flash technique with PCT processing method.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:introduction}  % \label{} allows reference to this section
In the Nondestructive Testing \& Evaluation (NDT \& E) field, Active InfraRed Thermography is a technique widely used in assessing the conditions of parts of material components\cite{Maldague2001theory}. Traditionally, Pulsed Thermography (PT) deploys a thermal stimulation pulse (flash or lamp heating) to produce a thermal contrast between the feature of interest and the background, then monitors the time evolution of the surface temperature by a thermal camera. With this rapidity and convenience, numerous studies have been devoted to this technique\cite{Maldague1993Nondestructive,Maldague1994bInfra,2007-Ibarra-Castanedo,2011-ClementeIbarra-Castanedo,duan2013quantitative}.

However, in the past in the scientific community, only a limited number of studies investigating a cold approach (cooling as the external stimulation in Active Infrared Thermography) have been performed on industrial product inspection\cite{endohdynamical2012,2012-LewisHom,Lei2016detection}. Thus, the advantage and convenience of using the cold stimulation in IT still remains to be investigated in detail and better understood. The aim of this paper is that of exploring the opposite external stimulation in IR Thermography: cooling instead of heating. Three methods (two traditional techniques, Pulsed Thermography and Lock-in Thermography act as the reference) will be applied on a steel slab with different sizes of flat-bottom-holes. The thermographic images of the experiments will be  treated to  eventually produce a binary map of the location of the defects. This map will be statistically evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity\cite{Fawcett2006} by comparison with the `true’ map of the defects, furnishing a rank of the three stimulation methods. 



\section{Experimental setup} % (fold)
\label{sec:experimental_setup}
One side stimulation approach is often used in the Infrared Thermography NDT \& E field, which is also known as the reflection scheme: both the stimulation device and the camera stay on the same side of the sample being tested. This approach applied in reality is shown in Figure~\ref{Exp_setup}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

   }
   \caption{Experimental set-up in the \textit{reflection} mode}
   \label{Exp_setup}
\end{figure}

The following equipment was set up for this study:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Infrared Camera FLIR SC3000 (320$\times$240 pixels, 50Hz, GaAs, 8-9 $\mu m$)
   \item Two pairs of flash halogen lamps for a total of 10 kJ (electric) released in 5 $ms$ 
   \item One pair of modulated halogen lamps with 1kW each served as Lock-in stimulation
   \item An isolated bottle full of Liquid Nitrogen
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specimen} % (fold)
\label{sub:specimen}
In this study, a steel specimen comprising flat-bottom holes of different depths and sizes will be examined. Their dimensions are depicted in Figure~\ref{specimen}.
   \begin{figure}[ht]

   \end{figure}  

The steel plate has seventeen holes whose diameters vary from 0.4 $cm$  to 3 $cm$, and whose depths (from bottom) vary from 0.3 $cm$ to 0.9 $cm$. The entire thickness is 1 $cm$. This specimen is painted before the test, in order to increase its emissivity and to obtain a homogeneous external stimulation.

\subsection{Stimulation Techniques} % (fold)
\label{sub:stimulation_techniques}
Three external stimulations were deployed on the sample, for the sake of  obtaining a good comparison in results: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Pulse Thermography (PT) 
   \item Lock-in Thermography (LIT)
   \item Liquid Nitrogen cooling (LN$_2$)
\end{itemize}
Known as the traditional and fast technique in NDT \& E, Pulse Thermography acts as the reference during this test. When neglecting heat exchange with the environment, the pulse of energy $Q$, delivered on a layer of thickness $L$, characterized by a density $\rho$, a specific heat $C_p$ and a thermal conductivity $\lambda$ (or a thermal diffusivity $\alpha$) produces a temperature increment behavior on the heated surface given by:
\begin{equation}
   T(t) = \frac{Q}{\rho C_p L}[1+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{n^2 \pi ^2\alpha t}{L^2}}]
   \label{eq_pt}
\end{equation}

For the situation of modulated periodic heating, 3 different angular frequencies $\omega$ of 0.0625~$Hz$ (LIT16--one period is equivalent to 16 seconds), 0.125~$Hz$ (LIT8--one period is equivalent to 8 seconds) and 0.25~$Hz$ (LIT4--one period is equivalent to 4 seconds) are performed in Lock-in Thermography. 
By the convolution integral, Eq~(\ref{eq_pt}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
   T(t) = \frac{W}{\lambda}\frac{\alpha}{L}\int_0^t d\tau \Big(1+\sin(\omega \tau - \frac{\pi}{2})\Big)\Big\{1+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{n^2 \pi ^2\alpha(t-\tau)}{L^2}}\Big\}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is the absorbed heating power.

The Liquid Nitrogen is applied in the test by means of pouring it out directly onto the surface in order to cool the sample. LN$_2$ was sprinkled onto the specimen center and allowed to spread out forwards the edges. The whole capture duration is 500 frames with 50~$Hz$ of image frequency, ie. 10 seconds of recording. The pouring time (cooling time) is about 2 seconds, with 100 frames in the results sequence. The experimental set-up is shown in Figure~\ref{Exp_LN2}.

\section{Processing Methods} % (fold)
\label{sec:processing_methods}
The following image-processing techniques and data-analysis methods were employed for this study:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Principal Component Thermography (PCT)
   \item Phase and Amplitude images Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
   \item Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC Curves)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Principal Component Thermography (PCT)}
The Principal Component Thermography technique\cite{Rajic2002} uses “singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the matrix of observations to a highly compact statistical representation of the spatial and temporal variations relating to contrast information associated with underlying structural flaws”.

\subsection{FFT in Phase and Amplitude for LIT}
In addition to the common technique for NDT \& E, Fast Fourier Transform in LIT\cite{wu1998lock} is also one of the most applied techniques in IR Thermography, which is based on the periodic heating of the object being tested. A thermal wave is likewise generated and propagates inside the material. In real experimental cases the thermal wave is composed by a principal frequency and several harmonics where the amplitude of the Fast Fourier Transform is a function of frequency. By selecting the component with the highest amplitude it is possible to produce a phase map at the corresponding frequency where the defect appears enhanced.


\subsection{ROC Curve analysis} % (fold)
\label{sub:roc_curve_analysis}
The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a technique in statistics which helps visualize, organize and select classifiers based on their performance. The curve graph is created by plotting the the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. More details about concepts and definitions can be found in [T. Fawcett 2006]\cite{Fawcett2006}. While being frequently chosen a standard method in several scientific fields, ROC are rarely applied in the thermographic field.\cite{Bison2014a} 

Implemented in this study, a binary map of the defect locations is built and correlated to the post-processed images in gray scale, and the lay-out is provided in Figure~\ref{binary}. The main algorithm in the calculation of TPR and FPR is clarified as:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Identify the best gray-scale result from the post-processing thermal images as the test image;
   \item Resize the defect map to the same size as that of the test image;
   \item Choose a thresholding step number $N$($N=1000$ in this study) and establish the step value of thresholding [from $0$, $\frac{1}{N}$, $\frac{2}{N}$ till $1 (=\frac{N}{N})$];
   \item For each thresholding step, binarize the test image with the thresholding and then compare it to the defect map, in order to obtain the corresponding TPR and FPR values;
   \item Iterate the binarization and comparison so as to plot a whole curve.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Thermal images comparison} 

From the results above, raw images in Figure~\ref{raw_results} indicate that the most detectable flaws are the ones with a high aspect ratio (ie. diameter-to-depth). In addition, for the PT stimulation, a small hole with diameter 0.4 $cm$, depth\footnote{It should be noted that the depth values mentioned here and after are from the bottom of the sample, therefore the real corresponding depths should be these values subtracted from the thickness.} 0.9 $cm$ (left-upper in Figure~\ref{Flash_raw23}) appeared in frame 23, and disappeared after, while another two holes with diameter 2 $cm$, depth 0.9 $cm$ and two with diameter 3 $cm$, depth 0.5 $cm$ (center in Figure~\ref{Flash_raw60}) appeared in frame 60.  Nonetheless, in LN$_2$ raw results, same defects as the one in Flash frame 60 appeared in LN$_2$ frame 41 (however, it should be noted that the first 100 frames of cooling time has been removed from the these final raw images.) After this, there was no more defect that emerged. Another remark is that since the LN$_2$ is sprinkled onto the center of the surface, there could be the situation that the center part of specimen was over cooled while the `cold front' (opposite to heat front) might have not be able to propagate to the edges. And due to the high conductivity of steel, defects only showed up at the beginning of the cooling procedure. These may be the main issues of pouring-out method.

For LIT results, FFT in Amplitude has a better flaw detection capability than FFT in Phase, as there is some noise in all of the Phase images. LIT8 and LIT16 have about four more detected flaws than LIT4. Whereas, for FFT in Phase for LIT8 and LIT16, there some inverse gray-scale values occur. This might be due to the reverse image question.

Following PCT processing, Figure~\ref{PCT_results} exhibits a clearer resutl. It can be observed that most of the flaws are visible, especially in the Flash image (Figure~\ref{PCT_Flash}. Less flaws are visible in the LIT4 PCT third image.
%The corresponding PCT results are represented in Figure~\ref{PCT_results}.

    \caption{PCT results of corresponding technique}
    \label{PCT_results}
\end{figure}


Comparing the processed thermal images, the following observations can be made:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item All techniques present part of the flaws in the sample;
    \item The PCT post-processing method displays a better results for all images;
    \item More defects are exhibited in Flash stimulation with PCT processing;
    %\item For LIT8 and LIT16, there are some reverse image question.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Corresponding ROC curves comparison}
The ROC curves obtained from comparing the binary map of defect locations to the above results are represented in Figure~\ref{ROC_curve}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \subfloat[ROC from PCT Results]
    {
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graph/ROC_PCT.png}
    }

    {
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graph/ROC_LIT_AMP.png}
    }
    \caption{ROC curves obtained from above results}
    \label{ROC_curve}
\end{figure}

In the ROC curves definitions, the \textit{sensitivity} is the True positive rate (\textit{tp rate}), and \textit{1-specificity} is the False positive rate (\textit{fp rate}).
From the curves of the PCT results, one can easily notice that the five curves have almost the same performance of classification in the beginning. When the \textit{tp rate} arrives at $0.3$, the PT curve becomes the nearest to the northwest (where the \textit{tp rate} is higher, the \textit{fp rate} is lower or both). The second one is the LN$_2$ curve. But it has a slightly higher \textit{tp rate} than PT after the \textit{fp rate} reaches $0.4$. The LIT8 and LIT16 curves have almost the same performance before the \textit{tp rate} attains $0.7$. After that the LIT16 has a higher \textit{tp rate} than LIT8. Whereas the LIT4 curve keeps closest to the diagonal line $y=x$, which represents the strategy of randomly guessing a class.

The situation is the same for the curves of LIT Amplitude, in that LIT4 has an unfavorable performance in classification. LIT16 also has a slightly higher \textit{tp rate} than LIT8. Because of the reverse image problem, only the LIT amplitude ROC curve is plotted.

\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}
This study investigates an external stimulation--cooling instead of heating in IR Thermography for NDT \& E. 
A steel specimen is used to test three different stimulations for thermal images and also ROC analysis comparison. 
Results shows that all techniques highlight part of the flaws in the sample, whereas the LN$_2$ technique represents the defects only at the beginning; this maybe due to the high conductivity of steel. 
In thermal results, the PCT post-processing method displays a better results for all procedures. More defects are exhibited in Flash stimulation with PCT processing.
ROC curve analysis has elucidated a straightforward classification comparison, in which the best curve obtained is by the Flash technique with PCT processing.

In future work, other common composite materials such as CFRP (Carbon fiber reinforced polymer), GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) will be chosen as specimen. The method of Liquid Nitrogen pouring may be replaced by spraying onto the sample surface, which can reduce the inhomogeneous cooling problem. To enhance the penetration of heat inside the sample, a proposition involving heating on one side of the specimen and cooling the other side might be taken into consideration.
Even though LN$_2$ technique in this study has not shown enough advantages, this exploration of an opposite means of external stimulation in InfraRed Thermography might favor new ideas of approaches for NDT \& E.

% If you use this formatting, your references will link your manuscript to other research papers that are in the CrossRef system. Exact punctuation is required for the automated linking to be successful. 

% Citations to the references are made using superscript numerals, as demonstrated in the above paragraph.  One may also directly refer to a reference within the text, e.g., ``as shown in Ref.~\citenum{Metropolis53} ...''

% \subsection{Footnotes}
% Footnotes\footnote{Footnotes are indicated as superscript symbols to avoid confusion with citations.} may be used to provide auxiliary information that doesn't need to appear in the text, e.g., to explain measurement units.  They should be used sparingly, however.  

% Only nine footnote symbols are available in LaTeX. If you have more than nine footnotes, you will need to restart the sequence using the command  \verb|\footnote[1]{Your footnote text goes here.}|. If you don't, LaTeX will provide the error message {\ttfamily Counter too large.}, followed by the offending footnote command.



% % \section{SECTION FORMATTING}
% %\label{sec:sections}

% Section headings are centered and formatted completely in uppercase 11-point bold font.  Sections should be numbered sequentially, starting with the first section after the Abstract.  The heading starts with the section number, followed by a period.  In LaTeX, a new section is created with the \verb|\section{}| command, which automatically numbers the sections.

% Paragraphs that immediately follow a section heading are leading paragraphs and should not be indented, according to standard publishing style\cite{Lamport94}.  The same goes for leading paragraphs of subsections and sub-subsections.  Subsequent paragraphs are standard paragraphs, with 14-pt.\ (5 mm) indentation.  An extra half-line space should be inserted between paragraphs.  In LaTeX, this spacing is specified by the parameter \verb|\parskip|, which is set in {\ttfamily spie.cls}.  Indentation of the first line of a paragraph may be avoided by starting it with \verb|\noindent|.
 
% \subsection{Subsection Attributes}

% The subsection heading is left justified and set in 11-point, bold font.  Capitalization rules are the same as those for book titles.  The first word of a subsection heading is capitalized.  The remaining words are also capitalized, except for minor words with fewer than four letters, such as articles (a, an, and the), short prepositions (of, at, by, for, in, etc.), and short conjunctions (and, or, as, but, etc.).  Subsection numbers consist of the section number, followed by a period, and the subsection number within that section.  

% \subsubsection{Sub-subsection attributes}
% The sub-subsection heading is left justified and its font is 10 point, bold.  Capitalize as for sentences.  The first word of a sub-subsection heading is capitalized.  The rest of the heading is not capitalized, except for acronyms and proper names.  

% \section{FIGURES AND TABLES}

% Figures are numbered in the order of their first citation.  They should appear in numerical order and on or after the same page as their first reference in the text.  Alternatively, all figures may be placed at the end of the manuscript, that is, after the Reference section.  It is preferable to have figures appear at the top or bottom of the page.  Figures, along with their captions, should be separated from the main text by at least 0.2 in.\ or 5 mm.  

% Figure captions are centered below the figure or graph.  Figure captions start with the figure number in 9-point bold font, followed by a period; the text is in 9-point normal font; for example, ``{\footnotesize{Figure 3.}  Original image...}''.  See Fig.~\ref{fig:example} for an example of a figure caption.  When the caption is too long to fit on one line, it should be justified to the right and left margins of the body of the text.  

% Tables are handled identically to figures, except that their captions appear above the table. 

%    \begin{figure} [ht]
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{c} %% tabular useful for creating an array of images 
%    \includegraphics[height=5cm]{mcr3b.eps}
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption[example] 
% %>>>> use \label inside caption to get Fig. number with \ref{}
%    { \label{fig:example} 
% Figure captions are used to describe the figure and help the reader understand it's significance.  The caption should be centered underneath the figure and set in 9-point font.  It is preferable for figures and tables to be placed at the top or bottom of the page. LaTeX tends to adhere to this standard.}
%    \end{figure} 

% \section{MULTIMEDIA FIGURES - VIDEO AND AUDIO FILES}

% Video and audio files can be included for publication. See Tab.~\ref{tab:Multimedia-Specifications} for the specifications for the mulitimedia files. Use a screenshot or another .jpg illustration for placement in the text. Use the file name to begin the caption. The text of the caption must end with the text ``http://dx.doi.org/doi.number.goes.here'' which tells the SPIE editor where to insert the hyperlink in the digital version of the manuscript. 

% Here is a sample illustration and caption for a multimedia file:

%    \begin{figure} [ht]
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{c} 
%    \includegraphics[height=5cm]{MultimediaFigure.jpg}
% 	\end{tabular}
% 	\end{center}
%    \caption[example] 
%    { \label{fig:video-example} 
% A label of “Video/Audio 1, 2, …” should appear at the beginning of the caption to indicate to which multimedia file it is linked . Include this text at the end of the caption: \url{http://dx.doi.org/doi.number.goes.here}}
%    \end{figure} 
   
%    \begin{table}[ht]
% \caption{Information on video and audio files that must accompany a manuscript submission.} 
% \label{tab:Multimedia-Specifications}
% \begin{center}       
% \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
% \hline
% \rule[-1ex]{0pt}{3.5ex}  Item & Video & Audio  \\
% \hline
% \rule[-1ex]{0pt}{3.5ex}  File name & Video1, video2... & Audio1, audio2...   \\
% \hline
% \rule[-1ex]{0pt}{3.5ex}  Number of files & 0-10 & 0-10  \\

% \rule[-1ex]{0pt}{3.5ex}  Size of each file & 5 MB & 5 MB  \\
% \hline
% \rule[-1ex]{0pt}{3.5ex}  File types accepted & .mpeg, .mov (Quicktime), .wmv (Windows Media Player) & .wav, .mp3  \\
% \hline 
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \end{table}

% \section{MISCELLANEOUS FORMATTING DETAILS}
% \label{sec:misc}

% It is often useful to refer back (or forward) to other sections in the article.  Such references are made by section number.  When a section reference starts a sentence, Section is spelled out; otherwise use its abbreviation, for example, ``In Sec.~2 we showed...'' or ``Section~2.1 contained a description...''.  References to figures, tables, and theorems are handled the same way.

% \subsection{Formatting Equations}
% Equations may appear in line with the text, if they are simple, short, and not of major importance; e.g., $\beta = b/r$.  Important equations appear on their own line.  Such equations are centered.  For example, ``The expression for the field of view is
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:fov}
% 2 a = \frac{(b + 1)}{3c} \, ,
% \end{equation}
% where $a$ is the ...'' Principal equations are numbered, with the equation number placed within parentheses and right justified.  

% Equations are considered to be part of a sentence and should be punctuated accordingly. In the above example, a comma follows the equation because the next line is a subordinate clause.  If the equation ends the sentence, a period should follow the equation.  The line following an equation should not be indented unless it is meant to start a new paragraph.  Indentation after an equation is avoided in LaTeX by not leaving a blank line between the equation and the subsequent text.

% References to equations include the equation number in parentheses, for example, ``Equation~(\ref{eq:fov}) shows ...'' or ``Combining Eqs.~(2) and (3), we obtain...''  Using a tilde in the LaTeX source file between two characters avoids unwanted line breaks.

% \subsection{Formatting Theorems}

% To include theorems in a formal way, the theorem identification should appear in a 10-point, bold font, left justified and followed by a period.  The text of the theorem continues on the same line in normal, 10-point font.  For example, 

% \noindent\textbf{Theorem 1.} For any unbiased estimator...

% Formal statements of lemmas and algorithms receive a similar treatment.
